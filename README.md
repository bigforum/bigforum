# Bigforum
ONLY FOR HISTORIC VALUES. DON'T DARE TO USE THIS IN ANY FORM ON A PRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. IT CONTAINS A LOT OF SECURITY RELATED ISSUES.

Bigforum was a forum project around September 2009 till ca. August 2011. Several people were involved to help with this project. A big "thank you" to you all. It was a great time and obviously, everyone has improved his or her skills by working on this piece of code and everything, which belonged to it. Including user support, communication within a team and with the public, blogging and project management in general.

However, it's also clear that we were bloody beginners at this time, so it's no wonder that you will find a lot of crap, if you look at the code.
